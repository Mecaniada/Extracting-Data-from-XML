Extracting Data from XML

The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum.
This is my assigment to Course 'Using Python to Access Web Data' made by Dr.Chuck for Coursera from University of Michigan. I highly suggest you to try and make for yourself the code because that's how you can learn something new and understand mode about Python.
